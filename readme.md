Hey! This is a summary of my final project. I have already started - I hand drew all of my wireframes (I can send pics if needed)

PROJECT NAME: Passport Beauty
MISSION: Passport Beauty is a unique and interactive way to discover beauty products from across the globe.

USER INTERFACE:
When you enter the website a clean homepage loads with a welcome message that describes how to use the site within a couple sentences.

When you click on this message, the message disappears, revealing an interactive map of the world.

When you hover over countries, a pop up is revealed with unique beauty products that originate from
that country.

PROGRESS:

So far I have created the initial welcome message, and have programmed it to disappear upon click.

I still have to figure out how to ID each country using the SVG file to target each upon click or hover.

I also have to design what the pop up will look like and what information it will display.

Thanks - Greta Harrison
